    "The Efficient Market Hypothesis is a theory whereby share prices reflect all information available to the public. Today, investment companies try to be the fastest at gathering and processing said information. Of course, they use and Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to extract the most information they can at the fastest possible speed. They use  technical indicators as well as sentiment of available news from every data source available (News, Twitter, Reddit, and probably others) in order to be among the first responders to expected market fluctuations.\n",
    "I want to demonstrate a basic model of how we can implement Deep Learning methods and Natural Language Processing to combine both news and technical indicators to predict stock price fluctuations.\n",
